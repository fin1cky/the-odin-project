        <!-- <a> is anchor element ==> it is defined by
            wrapping text/another HTML element we want to be 
            a link with <a> tag -->
        <!-- HTML attribute gives additional information
        to an HTML element and always goes in the element's
        opening tag. Attribute is made up of name and value -->
        <!-- href(hypertext reference) attribute, value of this
        attribute is the destination we want our link to go to. 
        Without this attribute the text wrapped within anchor tag
        will look like plain text, if it is present the browser
        will give the text blue colour and underline it to signify
        it is a link.-->
        <!-- target attribute specifies where the linked resource
        will be opened, by default it is '_self' which opens the link
        in the current tab. '_blank' opens the link in a new tab or window -->
        <!-- rel attribute describes the relation between the current
        page and the linked document. -->
        <!-- 'noopener' value prevents the
        opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which
        it was opened. This prevents phishing attacks - the opened
        link can change the original webpage to a different one to
        trick users (this is called tabnabbing) -->
        <!-- 'noreferrer' prevents the opened link from knowing
        which webpage or resource has a link(or 'reference') to it.
        It includes the noopener behaviour and can be used by itself as well. -->
        <!-- target = '_blank' provides rel="noopener noreferrer" security
        by default, but it is a good coding practice to pair
        target="_blank" with rel="noopener noreferrer" -->
        <!-- Absolute links - links to pages on other websites on the
        internet. A typical absolute link is made up of
        protocol://domain/path
        Absolute link will always contain protocol and domain -->
        <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>
        <!-- This is a relative link, which are links to other
        pages on our own website, it does not inclyde the domain
        name since it is another page on the same site, it assumes
        the domain name will be the same, they only include the 
        file path to the other page relative to the page you are
        creating the link on. Relative to index.html, about.html is in
        pages directory. -->
        <!-- Prepending './' before the link will prevent any
        unexpected issues. By adding './' we are specifying to
        your code that it should start looking for the
        file/directory relative to the current directory. -->
        <!-- Think of your domain name (town.com) as a town, 
        the directory in which your website is located (/museum) 
        as a museum, and each page on your website as a room in 
        the museum (/museum/movie_room.html and 
        /museum/shops/coffee_shop.html). Relative links like 
        ./shops/coffee_shop.html are directions from the current 
        room (the museum movie room /museum/movie_room.html) to 
        another room (the museum shop). Absolute links, on the 
        other hand, are full directions including the protocol (https), 
        domain name (town.com) and the path from that 
        domain name (/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html): 
        https://town.com/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html. -->
        <img src="./images/dog.jpg" alt="Charles, the dog" height="853" width="640">
        <!-- img element is self-closing, it does not need a 
        closing tag. src attribute tells the browser where the
        image file is located, it can embed an image using
        both absolute and relative paths. -->
        <!-- check about.html for Parent directories info -->
        <!-- alt (alternative text) attribute is used to 
        describe an image, it will be used in place of the image 
        if it cannot be loaded. It is also used with screen 
        readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users. -->
        <!-- images always need to have src and alt attributes. -->
        <!-- height and width attributes not strictly required
        but helps the browser layout the page without causing the
        page to jump and flash. Good habit to specify these
        attributes on every image, even if image is the correct
        size or you are using CSS to modify it. -->
        <!-- you can write like this too:
        <img src="./images/dog.jpg" alt="Charles, the dog" height="853" width="640" /> 
        This was used in older versions of html, not needed in html5.-->
