    <!-- relative to about.html, we first go out of the
    pages directory into its parent directory and then
    access the images directory. To go to parent directory
    we need to use two dots: ../  -->
    <!-- Using the metaphor we used earlier, using ../ in a 
    filepath is kind of like stepping out from the room you 
    are currently in to the main hallway so you can go to 
    another room. -->
