is used in combination with other text elements like the
<p> tag. -->
<!-- <em> (stands for emphasis) element makes text italic and also places semantic
emphasis just like <strong>. It can also be used in

<!-- Nesting elements within other elements creates a parent and child
relationship between them. The two <p> elements are siblings, they are
children of the <body> element and the <body> element is the parent.
It is recommended to indent any child element by two spaces. -->
